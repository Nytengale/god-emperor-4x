# What is Cult of the god empeor?
"Cult of the God Emperor" is a 4X strategy game about ruling a galactic empire. It explores power, loyalty, belief, and politics through the lens of an immortal ruler. Players compete with rival civilizations to build an interstellar empire while relying on a diverse cast of ambitious characters to help them govern. Inspired by games like Crusader Kings 3, Stellaris, Rimworld and Aurora 4X, Cult of the God emperor is a character-driven take on 4X strategy, that prioritizes emergent storytelling over micromanagement.

Genre: 4X, Strategy

Features
It is a story generation engine. The goal is to generate epic tales from a play session, where the player feels like they are in control of a living, breathing empire in a vast galaxy. The tools created to facilitate that experience:
- Character-driven: The Prometheus engine is being developed in house to be a highly detailed character simulator. Personality, history, life events, relationships, beliefs, traits and skills are modelled and generated to create rich detailed characters.
- Story not left to chance: The Yarnspinner Engine will (guided by different storyteller presets) try to steer the story, challenge the player by sending events their way and react to the player's actions. By cleanly dividing the game into 4 eras, we will try to get a coherent story with a beginning, middle and end.
- Engame: The 4X genre is notorious for underwhelming endgame scenarios. We will try to rectify that by having challenges towards the end of a playthrough. Scenarios include
	- Reaper-style threat: An extragalactic invader tries to kill all life and all civilizations must unite to defeat them or try to go it alone.
	- Entangling alliances: Players must choose a side in a multipolar galactic conflic that has bloc of alliances and mutual defence pacts. Similar to how World War 1 played out in our history.
- Clean UI: The UI shouldn't feel overwhelming. Clean, harmonic, UI that relaxes the player.
- Uncluttered UX: We aim to give the player the information needed to make decisions in front of them and no more. A richly detailed simulation doesn't have to be a slog to go through. 
- Shareable: The Yarnspinner Engine gives the player Native tools to allow players to share their stories in text or short-form videos.
